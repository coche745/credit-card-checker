## General Info
I created this project as part of Codecademy's curriculum. The scenerio below is made up.

Context: I am a clerk who checks if credit card numbers are valid. My coworkers use pencil and paper to check, but I will optimize the process with my knowledge of functions and loops so I can check multiple credit cards at a time, and beat them to the next promotion!
## Technologies
+ Javascript
## Features
+ Check if a credit card number is valid, using the Luhn algorithm.
+ Find invalid numbers out of list of 15 credit card numbers.
+ Find out which credit card companies issued the invalid numbers.
+ Turn invalid card numbers into valid ones.
+ Make sure my functions work by taking numbers from an online credit card generator and testing to see if they are valid.
+ The online generator gives me the numbers as strings, in order to test my function I first turn them into arrays.
+ Check multiple online generated card numbers at once to see if they are valid.

You can see examples of these features by running the project on your own computer.
